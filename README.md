# Hospital Management System

## Overview
The Hospital Management System is a Terminal-C++ application designed to manage patient records in a hospital setting. It allows users to perform various operations such as adding patients, searching for patients, calculating bills, updating patient information, and discharging patients. The data is stored in a binary file for persistence.

## Features
- **Display Patients**: View all registered patients and their details.
- **Add Patient**: Add a new patient to the system with auto-incremented ID.
- **Search for Patient**: Search for a patient by ID and name.
- **Calculate Patient's Bill**: Calculate the bill based on room price and duration of stay.
- **Update Patient**: Update patient details such as name, room assignment, and duration of stay.
- **Discharge Patient**: Remove a patient from the system and organize IDs.
- **Data Persistence**: Patient data is stored in a binary file (`hospital.dat`).
